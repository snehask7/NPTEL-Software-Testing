# Logic Coverage Criteria  
* P: set of predicates, C: set of Clauses in P  
* Predicate coverage: For each p in P, TR has 2 requirements, p evaluates to True and False  
* For predicates associated with branches, predicate coverage and edge coverage are the same thing  
* Clause coverage: for each clause c in C, TR has 2 requirements, c evaulates to true and c is false  
* Clause coverage does not subsume predicate coverage  
* Combinatorial coverage (multiple condition coverage): For each p in P, All possible truth value combinations must be included for the clauses in P (Cp)  
* Combinatorial coverage is not feasible  
* Clause determining a predicate: the value of the clause is the same as the value of the predicate. The values of the other clauses do not matter.  
* Clause which is the focus is the major clause and the other clauses are minor clauses  
* Each clause is treated as a major clause  
* Active clause coverage: Major clause must be made true once and false once  
* For a predicate with n clauses, active vlause coverage has n+1 TRs   
* Modified condition decision coverage (MCDC): Same as active clause coverage  
* MCDC is manditory for safety critical software  
* In ACC, we dont consider values of minor clauses.  
* Types of ACC:  
  * General ACC: Same as active clause coverage, and the value of the minor clauses dont have to be the same for when major clause is true and false. GACC does not subsume predicate coverage.  
  * Correlated ACC: Minor clauses correlate with each other. The values chosen for minor clause must make the predicate to evaluate to True for one value of the major clause and false for the other value of the major clause. CACC subsumes predicate coverage  
  * Restricted ACC: The value of the minor clauses have to be the same for when the major clause is true and false
