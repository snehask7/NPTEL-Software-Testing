#  Mutation Operators  
* Operators mimic programmer mistakes so change relational operators or variable references  
* FailOnZero() is a common testing heuristic so every programmer must check this  
* Effective mutation operators: If tests are created that kill mutants created by a set of mutation operators O={o1,o2,..} also kill mutants created by all remaining operators with high probability then O is a set of effective mutation operators  
* Difficult to find effective mutation operators  
* Mutation operators that insert unary and modify unary and binary operators are effective  
  
List of mutation operators  
* **Absolute Value Insertion**: Each arithmetic expression is modified by functino abs, negabs, failonzero  
* **Arithmetic Operator Replacement**: Each occurence of +,-,*,/,**,% is replaced by each other. leftOp returns the left operand and ignored the right. rightop returns right and ignores left.  
* **Relational Operator Replacement**: <,>,<=,>=,=,!= is replaced by each of the others and by falseOp and trueOp where falseOp always returns false and trueOp always returns true  
* **Conditional Operator Replacement**: Each occurrence of logical operator &&,||,& - and without conditional, | - or without condition, not - ^ is replaced by each pf the others. Additionally falseOp, trueOp, leftOp, rightOp are also present  
* **Shift Operator Replacement**: Each occurrence of <<,>>,>>> is replaced by another, and also leftOp which returns left operand unshifted  
* **Logical Operator Replacement**: Bitwise logical operators are replaced by each other: &, |, ^(xor) and also by leftOp,rightOp, true,false  
* **Assignment Operator Replacement**: +=,-=,/=,*=,%=,<<=,>>= replaced by each other  
* **Unary Operator Insertion**: Unary operators are +,-,conditional,logical ~ is inserted before each expression  
* **Unary Operator Deletion**: Unary operators are +,-,conditional,logical ~ are deleted from ecpressions  
* **Scalar Variable Replacement**: Replace each variable reference with another variable of the same type and within the scope  
* **Bomb statement replacement**: replace each statement with bomb which signals failure
