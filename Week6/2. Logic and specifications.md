* specifications can be written in english or formal language  
* logic expressions can be included in the specifications  
* if the specifications are informal then specifications must be derived  
* Pre conditions and post conditions contain predicates  
* invariants might specify mutual exclusion property and include predicates  
* assertions also include predicates and are used for debugging  
  
* Code usually includes preconditions  
* ACC is very easy if it is in CNF form or DNF  
* If in CNF, Make all minor clauses true. Make the major clause true once and false once  
* If i DNF, Make all minor clauses false and make the major clause true once and false once  
* Some clauses are dependent on each other so sometimes 2 cannot b=be true or false at the same time  for clause coverage
