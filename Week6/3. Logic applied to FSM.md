* FSM can have predicates in the transitions  
* Apply logic coverage criterias to the predicates
* There could be errors in the FSM model, and when doing CACC inconstitencies in the truth values are found
* Testing based on FSM is called model based testing  
* Model based testing helps detect errors at early stages  
* Logical predicates occus as guards in FSM
