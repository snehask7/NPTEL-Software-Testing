#  Algorithms: Data flow coverage criteria  
* Data flow coverage criteria is a set of du-paths  
* Grouping of du paths can be done in 2 ways:  
  * As per definitions - def-path set: Consider all du-paths wrt a variable defined in a node ex:(du(ni,v) is set of all du-paths wrt to var v that start at ni). du(ni,v) 
  * As per def and use - def-pair set: Set of du-paths with respect to a variable that start and end at node i and node j. It is from a given definition to a given use, du(ni,nj,v)  
  * A test path p is said to du tour a sub path d with respect to v if p tours d and the portion pf p to which d corresponds is def-clear wrt v  
  * def-clear side trips are also allowed  
  * DU paths are simple  
      
### Data flow criteria  
* Each def reaches atleast 1 use  
* Each def reaches all possible uses  
* Each def reaches all possible uses through all du paths  
  
* **ALL-defs coverage**: For each def path set S, the TR contains atleast one path d in S (each def reaches atleast 1 use)  
* **All-uses coverage**: For each def pair set S, TR contains atleast one path d in S ( atleast 1 path for every def use pair)  
* **All-du-paths coverage**: For each def-pair set S, TR contains every path d in S  
  
* Every use is preceded by a def  
* Every def reaches atleast one use  
* For every node with many outgoing edges, atleast one variable is used on each out edge and the same variables are used on all out edges  
  
* If all uses is satisfied, then all defs also satisfied  
* If all du-paths is satisfied, then all uses satisfied so all defs too  
* All uses coverage subsumes edge coverage  
* Prime path coverage subsumes all du-path  
  
* For an input program, data flow analysis is done  
* Then def-use pairs are identified and for each du-pair test data is generated  
* If du-pair is covered then test case generated. Otherwise another du-pair is taken
