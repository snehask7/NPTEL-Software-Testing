* Adjacency list is useful for sparse (not many edges but many vertices) and Adjacency matrix is good for dense graphs (Many edges)  
* Adjacency list: |V| lists where each list has all the vertices conected to that vertex  
* Space for adjacency list is O(|V|+|E|)  
* Adjacency matrix is |V|x|V|  
  
### BFS  
* Explores adjacency list of start vertex, adds to queue, and takes one from the list at a time and explores each  
* Computes the distance from start vertex to reachable verties  
* Path from start to vertex in bfs tree is shortest path  
  
* Uses 3 colors : white, gray, black  
* Initially a vertex is white. It is not discovered  
* When discovered but not explored, becomes gray and added to the queue  
* When fully explored and removed from the queue it is made black  
  
* BFS running time is O(V+E)  
* Distance in the bfs tree is number of edges from start vertex to that vertex  
  
* BFS discovers every reachable vertex and also the shortest distance. Also, for a vertex v, the shortest path from the root is the shortest path from the root to the parent of vertex v plus the edge from the parent to v.  
* v.pi is parent of v  
* Predecessor subgraph is a bfs tree  
* The shortest path distance increases as we explore the graph  
* The distance value for each vertex is greater than or equal to to the shortest path distance from the start to that vertex  
  
### DFS  
* 2 timestamps used, v.d when first discovered(colored gray) and v.f (v is colored black).  
* v.d < v.f for every vertex  
* v.d and v.f are both between 1 and 2|V|  
* initialize a time variable to 0 initially.  
* for each vertex u  the graph, if it is white, visit it  
  DFS VISIT  
  * increment time  
  * u.d=time  
  * it is made gray  
  * for each vertex adjacent to u, if it is not yet discovered (white), make u the parent and visit that vertex  
  * make u black since it is explored  
  * increment time  
  * u.f=time    
    
* DFS visit is called once for every vertex  
* Running time is O(V+E)  
  
* in DFS of a graph G, every edge of G is a tree edge or a back edge  
  * tree edge: edges in the depth first forest  
  * back edges: edge connecting descendant to ancestor, also self loop  
  * forward edges: edge connecting a vertex to its descendant  
  * cross edges: all other edges  
    
* Paranthesis Theorem: for any 2 vertices u and v,  
  * if [u.d,u.f] and [v.d,v.f] are disjoint, u is not a descendant of v and vice versa also  
  * if [u.d,u.f] is contained in [v.u,v.f] then u is a descendant of v  
  * v is a proper descendant of u if u.d<v.d<u.f<v.f  
    
* Strongly connected component is a cycle in a directed graph. All vertices are reachable from each other. self loops are also included  
* Transpose of a graph would be the graph with every edge direction reversed  
* Graph and its transpose have the same strongly connected components  
  
* Finding strongly connected components:  
  * Call DFS  
  * Find transpose of the graph  
  * Run DFS on the reversed graph but consider vertices in decreasing order of finish times  
  * Output vertices in each tree in the DFS forest as a SCC  
    
Correctness of DFS (component graph)  
* Take all the strongly connected component, collapse each one to create a meta vertex.  
* There is an edge in the component graph if the graph has a directed edge from one strongly connected component to another  
* component graph is acyclic  
  
* Discovery and finish time for a component is the least of all and highest of all vertices  
* If there are 2 SCC C and C', then if there is an edge from C to C', finish time of C is greater than finish time of C'
